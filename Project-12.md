# ANSIBLE REFACTORING AND STATIC ASSIGNMENTS (IMPORTS AND ROLES)
### This is a continuation of Project 11 Ansible-Config-mgt repository
### [This is the link to project 12 repository](https://github.com/fola2022/Ansible-Config-mgt.git)
### First, directory called ansible-config-artifact was created on the jenkin-ansible server to store all artifacts after each build in other to save space on the server and Jenkins was configured to copy artifact and a new freestyle project called save_artifact was created as the downstream project for ansible project.
##### Command: 
```
sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
chmod -R 0777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
```

### REFACTORING ANSIBLE CODE BY IMPORTING OTHER PLAYBOOKS INTO SITE.YML
#### In the Ansible-Config-mgt repository, a new branch was created, named refactor
#### In the playbooks directory, a site.yml file was created to serve as an entry point into th entire infrastructure configuration
#### Static-assignments folder was created in the Ansible-Config-mgt repository
#### Commom.yml file was moved to static-assignments folder
#### site.yml file import to commom.yml playbook

### CONFIGURing UAT WEBSERVERS WITH A ROLE â€˜WEBSERVER'
#### Two Ec2 instances was used as webservers, named web1-uat and web2-uat. Also a roles directory was created on the jenkins/ansible instance inside the ansible-config-mgt repository and inside the roles folder, webserver folder was created.
```
sudo mkdir roles
```
<img width="425" alt="mkdir" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112771723/197399312-430e9de0-f9a2-462c-9383-27bd2ffaba03.png">

#### Updating inventory ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml file with IP addresses of the 2 UAT Web servers
```
[uat-webservers]
<Web1-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 
<Web2-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 
```
<img width="328" alt="uat updated" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112771723/197399394-5bce3380-1d6b-4572-aa5e-be5b4fcb19e1.png">

#### In /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file, the roles_path string was uncommented and the full path to the roles directory roles_path was provided so Ansible could know where to find configured roles.

#### Within the static-assignments folder, uat-webservers.yml file was created and updated with the below code
```
---
- hosts: uat-webservers
  roles:
     - webserver
```
#### Since the entry point of the configuration is site.yml, the file was updated with the below code
```
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml

- hosts: uat-webservers
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml
